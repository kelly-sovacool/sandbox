# sandbox
a sandbox for testing & exploration

I created a GitHub Actions workflow to fast-forward the `latest-release` branch whenever a release is published, and configured GitHub Pages to build the website from this branch. So now the website will always contain the content from the latest release (rather than the development version).
I tested this out here before using it for [mikropml](https://github.com/SchlossLab/mikropml).
